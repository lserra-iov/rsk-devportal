- [Using MetaMask wallet](#performing-a-peg-out-transaction-using-metamask)
- [Using Liquality wallet](#performing-a-peg-out-transaction-using-liquality)

> Note we will be using the 2 way peg app on [2 way peg app - Testnet](https://2wp-app.testnet.rsk.co/) for learning purposes, for transactions using real tokens, please use the [2 way peg app - Mainnet](https://2wp-app.rsk.co/) application.
